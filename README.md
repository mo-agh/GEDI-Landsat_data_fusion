# GEDI-Landsat Data Fusion

This project quantified biomass loss due to saltwater intrusion in Wicomico, Somerset, and Dorchester counties, Maryland. The GEDI L4A biomass product served as the dependent variable in a random forest regression model, with Landsat-8 bands as independent variables. Landsat-8 data for the study area were collected using the Google Earth Engine platform. The trained model produced wall-to-wall biomass maps for 2013 and 2021.
